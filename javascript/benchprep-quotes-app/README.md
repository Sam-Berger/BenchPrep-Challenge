## Notes to Evaluators

Thank you for the opportunity to try out for the the Junior Software Engineer position. I hope my code passes muster.

Here are a few things to note in this Vue app:

- This is my first Vue project. I learned quite a bit completing this, and it rings true that the best way to learn a new language/framework is to do a project. My newness may be reflected in the code. I did not know how to get the project initialized from the files originally supplied in the Github repo. I created a new Vue project and modified to complete this assignment. Instructions may be helpful for someone like me in the future who is so new to Vue (this is a junior role, and I have a lot to learn).
- I added additional functionality and features from what was originally requested.
  - I added in an "Show All Quotes" button so that users could access all the quotes after filtering for just movie or game quotes.
  - I made the logic work so that the text search does not just return the result from all the quotes provided, but it can use all the quotes, or just the movie or game quotes depending on what button has been clicked.
  - While making something that looks good was not requested, I added in some very basic CSS from Bootstrap CSS. I figure you are more interested in what is happening behind the scenes, but I like my websites to at least look presentable

As a absolutely unimportant issue, the quote from Portal "The cake is a lie" is attributed here to corpse. In game we don't see a corpse when we see this wall scribbling, and we know from additional material that it was written by Doug Rattmann (https://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Doug_Rattmann).

Thank you!
